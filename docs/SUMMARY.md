When I started this task, I carefully read through every line of the instructions to make sure I understood what was needed. To help myself plan, I created an Excalidraw diagram to visualize the requirements and the flow of the project.

I began by setting up the Dockerfile and chose Flask to handle the HTTP requests, focusing on the GET methods as required. After that, I wrote the code for the Docker container, making sure to implement both the `/secret` and `/health` endpoints. The `/secret` endpoint returns the secret from DynamoDB, and the `/health` endpoint provides links to the GitHub repository and the Docker Hub container.

When I tried to get the DynamoDB item, I used `get_item` because I assumed the table only had a partition key. However, I encountered an error saying the key schema was not appropriate. I then tried using `query`, `scan`, and even `describe` to get more information about the table structure, but I didnâ€™t have the necessary permissions for those operations.

Unfortunately, I was not able to retrieve the secret key from the table due to these limitations.

Once the Docker setup was ready, I built the image locally and used `docker-compose up` to run it. I tested the endpoints to confirm they were accessible on localhost.

Next, I created accounts on Docker Hub and Travis CI. I wrote a `.travis.yml` file so that every push to the master branch on GitHub would trigger Travis to build, test, and push the Docker image to my Docker Hub account.

Finally, I added a simple test to check that the `/health` endpoint on my Flask app returns a 200 status code. This test helps make sure the service is running as expected.
